# CODEFORGE - JavaScript Assignments for Beginners

This repository contains a set of beginner-friendly JavaScript programming assignments designed to help new learners practice and reinforce their understanding of basic JavaScript concepts, including syntax, data types, control structures, and functions.

## Assignments

1. **Temperature Converter**:

    Write a program that converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa. Use functions to perform the conversion and prompt the user for input. Use conditional statements to determine the conversion type (Celsius to Fahrenheit or Fahrenheit to Celsius).

2. **Simple Calculator**:

    Create a simple calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Use functions for each operation and prompt the user for input. Use a switch statement to determine which operation to perform based on the user's input.

3. **FizzBuzz**:

    Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz". Use a for loop to iterate through the numbers and conditional statements to determine what to print.

4. **Palindrome Checker**:

    Write a function that checks whether a given word or phrase is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same backward as forward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). Use string and array methods, as well as loops and conditional statements to determine if the input is a palindrome. Test the function with various words and phrases.

5. **Simple Todo List**:

    Create a simple todo list where a user can add and remove tasks. Use an array to store the tasks and functions to add, remove, and display the tasks. Use loops to iterate through the tasks when displaying them, and use conditional statements and array methods to add and remove tasks.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account by clicking the "Fork" button in the top-right corner.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/codeforgecamp/basic-programming.git

3. Navigate to the repository folder:

cd javascript-assignments-for-beginners

4. Create a new branch for your submission:

git checkout -b your-branch-name

5. Create a new folder for each assignment, and start working on the assignment using your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text).

## Instructions

For each assignment, follow the guidelines below:

1. Use appropriate data types (String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined) and variables to store and manipulate data.
2. Leverage constants when necessary.
3. Employ arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators as needed.
4. Use conditional statements (if, else if, else) and switch statements for decision-making.
5. Implement loops (for, while, do-while) for iteration.
6. Define and use functions, including function parameters and arguments, return statements, and anonymous functions.
7. Test your solution with various inputs and edge cases to ensure correctness.

## Submission

Once you have completed an assignment, commit your changes to the repository and push them to your GitHub account:

1. Add your changes:

git add .

2. Commit the changes:

git commit -m "Completed Assignment X"

3. Push the changes to your GitHub account:

git push origin your-branch-name

4. Create a pull request against the original repository by navigating to the "Pull Requests" tab in your forked repository and clicking the "New Pull Request" button.
